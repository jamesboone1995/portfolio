            <p>My name is James, I'm from Orange County California, and I've been programming since October 2019.
            I have been studying web development for the past year as well as working at a marketing firm at which I assist small businesses design strategies to attract new customers online.
            </p>
            <p>I am a professional individual looking to start my career in web development and I believe I would be the perfect fit for your web development role. I am currently seeking full time employment as a web developer. While I am relatively new to the web development world, that's what makes working with me so valuable. I'm seeking a career in this industry and cannot afford to put in half effort on anything I do. You'd be working with someone who's spent their last 5 years in sales, so it's not that just that I know how to work a job, I know how to earn my pay. I appreciate the any and all opportunities and look forward to hearing from you.
